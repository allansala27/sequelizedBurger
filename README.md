## Description on how to use the app
 - This program is a burger storage that allows users to add burgers and devour them whenever they want.

## Requirements
- The requirements of this assignment were to create persistence in burger data by using the mySQL database as well as have the assignment run run via express server and template using Handlebars.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Jquery
- mySQL
- Sequelize
- Express.js
- Handlebars

## Code Explaination
- My first task was to set up the express server.
- Once that was complete, I created the burger model to pass into the database using sequelize and making the model sync with the database the moment the server starts running.
- After, I setup the get/post routing system to handle requests.
- I then created the necessary HTML components to get the name of the burger the user wishes to add.
- I finally created the functions to handle CRUD operations for the burgers.
